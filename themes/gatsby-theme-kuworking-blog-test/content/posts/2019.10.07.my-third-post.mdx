# My third post

# File not found.

There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Do a flip! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. __You guys aren't Santa!__ *You're not even robots.* How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

## Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

1. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!
2. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
3. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

### But existing is basically all I do!

Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.

* Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!
* So, how 'bout them Knicks?
* I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?

I had more, but you go ahead. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! I'll get my kit! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!

Moving along… Who are you, my warranty?! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Oh God, what have I done? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Ow, my spirit! I'm Santa Claus! Fry, we have a crate to deliver.

What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

Kids have names? Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Who are those horrible orange men? Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. How much did you make me? I never loved you. No, just a regular mistake. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!

Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Also Zoidberg. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Belligerent and numerous.
