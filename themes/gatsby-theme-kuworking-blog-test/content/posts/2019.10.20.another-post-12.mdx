Now, look here, my good man. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. __On second thoughts, let's not go there.__ *It is a silly place.* Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.

He hasn't got shit all over him. He hasn't got shit all over him. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!

Look, my liege! Be quiet! Why? …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Where'd you get the coconuts? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.

Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! We found them. Well, how'd you become king, then? You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!

She looks like one. Well, I got better. Burn her anyway! Camelot! Well, I got better.

Shut up! Well, I didn't vote for you. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.

You don't vote for kings. She looks like one. And the hat. She's a witch! Burn her anyway! Well, she turned me into a newt.

You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! Well, how'd you become king, then?

You don't vote for kings. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Look, my liege! Look, my liege!

On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! I dunno. Must be a king. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!
