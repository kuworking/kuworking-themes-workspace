# Another post

# Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? I love you, buddy! There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Bender, we're trying our best.

__ suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!__ *We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.* Soothe us with sweet lies.

## Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

Negative, bossy meat creature! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

1. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.
2. Large bet on myself in round one.
3. Bender?! You stole the atom.

### Hello, little man. I will destroy you!

But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Bender, you risked your life to save me! OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.

* In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.
* I never loved you.
* You're going to do his laundry?

Is that a cooking show? You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.

Who are you, my warranty?! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Bender, we're trying our best. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I love you, buddy! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! I'll get my kit! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Kids have names?

I never loved you. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

Who am I making this out to? That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Oh yeah, good luck with that. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!

I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Say what? No. We're on the top. Your best is an idiot! Shut up and take my money! But existing is basically all I do!

Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Your best is an idiot! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.
