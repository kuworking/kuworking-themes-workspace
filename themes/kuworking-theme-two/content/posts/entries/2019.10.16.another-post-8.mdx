# Another post

# Cops, another community I'm not part of.

Keep your mind limber. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. You're a killer. I catch killers. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. You all right, Dexter? __I will not kill my sister.__ *I will not kill my sister.* I will not kill my sister.

## You look…perfect.

I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. You look…perfect. I am not a killer. This man is a knight in shining armor. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.

1. You're a killer. I catch killers.
2. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.
3. Makes me a … scientist.

### I am not a killer.

I'm generally confused most of the time. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. You look…perfect.

* Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.
* I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.
* I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

You look…perfect. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm partial to air conditioning. You're a killer. I catch killers.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I am not a killer. Hello, Dexter Morgan. I'm really more an apartment person.

I'm really more an apartment person. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.

I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.

I'm generally confused most of the time. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. You look…perfect. Like a sloth. I can do that. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.
