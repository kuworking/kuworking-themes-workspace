# Another post

# What!?

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. __She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.__ *Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander.* There'll be no one to stop us this time!

## Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I'm trying not to, kid. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I'm trying not to, kid.

1. I'm trying not to, kid.
2. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.
3. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.

### He is here.

Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I'm trying not to, kid.

* Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
* Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?
* I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't underestimate the Force. I call it luck. Don't underestimate the Force.

As you wish. As you wish. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- As you wish. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

Partially, but it also obeys your commands. He is here. As you wish. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?

Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!
