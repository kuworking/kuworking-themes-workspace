# Another post

# You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Obi-Wan is here. __The Force is with him.__ *Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.* The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

## I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? You mean it controls your actions?

1. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
2. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
3. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

### Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. He is here. I'm trying not to, kid. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?

* You mean it controls your actions?
* I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?
* In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.

Partially, but it also obeys your commands. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

What!? What?! Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
