## 🤝 Relation between the theme and the starter

- The theme, which is consumed by this starter, is the responsible of all the logic of the website
- This starter stores all the content of the site (pages, posts, images, ...)

And as usual, the starter has the capacity to shadow any file of the theme to modify it at will

## 🎬 Posts and Post images

- Posts are stored in `./content/posts` and have the structure `2019.10.05.my-first-post.mdx`
- The first _date_ part is necessary and is useful to sort files by date in a file explorer
- The post image is stored in `./content/posts/images` and has the structure of `my-first-post.jpg`, this is, the same name than the post except the _date_ part

## 🏗️ How to add a post?

The easiest way is to modify or copy-paste any example post present in this starter and follow its structure

The structure is like this

```js
---
date: 2019-10-05
title: 'My first #post#! 1'
tags: gatsby, kuworking, themes
snippet: 'This is my first post, where the snippet aims to appear in Google'
abstract: 'This is my #first# post, and this is an abstract '
---

import { Link } from 'gatsby'

# My first post

```

The first part between `---` is known as the _frontmatter_ and is written in YAML, there you specify the date, title, tags, snippet and abstract

- The date marked there is the one that is translated into the post, this date should match the one in the filename for consistency, but it is not necessary, the date in the filename is only useful for sorting purposes in the explorer
- In relation to the tags, Gatsby will create a page for each tag present in these post frontmatters (containing the posts that have these tags)
- The snippet refers to the description that will appear in RSS feeds, schema and meta tag
- The abstract is the description of the post that may appear in the grid of the website
