# My second post

# Why do you think that she is a witch?

The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Why do you think that she is a witch? The nose? But you are dressed as oneâ€¦ Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!

I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! __Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!__ *Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!* Where'd you get the coconuts?

## Bring her forward!

Oh, ow! A newt? You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Oh, ow! Why do you think that she is a witch?

1. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
2. And the hat. She's a witch!
3. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.

### Bloody Peasant!

You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! Who's that then?

* Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!
* Where'd you get the coconuts?
* Where'd you get the coconuts?

Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Burn her anyway! Well, we did do the nose. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!

And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Bloody Peasant! Where'd you get the coconuts? Why?

Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Now, look here, my good man. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Why?

Well, what do you want? The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! How do you know she is a witch?

Well, what do you want? We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Where'd you get the coconuts? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.

I dunno. Must be a king. Well, we did do the nose. Burn her! Burn her! The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! The nose?

Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. What do you mean? Well, what do you want? I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

What do you mean? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Camelot! Shut up!

Well, what do you want? Oh, ow! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. I'm not a witch. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!

I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! Why?

Well, she turned me into a newt. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Why do you think that she is a witch? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!
