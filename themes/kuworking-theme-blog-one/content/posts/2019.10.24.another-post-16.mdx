# Another post

# I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Saving the world with meals on wheels. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! __You've swallowed a planet!__ *No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.* Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

## No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

3. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

### *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

* You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?
* You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

Saving the world with meals on wheels. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! You hit me with a cricket bat. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
