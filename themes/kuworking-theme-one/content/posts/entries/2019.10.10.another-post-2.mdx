# Another post

# Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention!

Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.

__ was saying "Boo-urns.__ * I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!* This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story.

## Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.

They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.

1. He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?!
2. Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train!
3. I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.

### I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.

Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box… When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun.

* We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.
* Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer?
* Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.

What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.

Human contact: the final frontier. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?

Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Inflammable means flammable? What a country. I was saying "Boo-urns." You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity.

Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.

Me fail English? That's unpossible. I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!

Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.

I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.

Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box…

Me fail English? That's unpossible. I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?

We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me.
