# Another post
# Watching ice melt. This is fun.

I'm really more an apartment person. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I'm generally confused most of the time. You all right, Dexter? God created pudding, and then he rested.

You all right, Dexter? I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. __I will not kill my sister.__ *I will not kill my sister.* I will not kill my sister.


## I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.

1. Keep your mind limber.
2. He taught me a code. To survive.
3. Watching ice melt. This is fun.

### I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.

Watching ice melt. This is fun. I'm generally confused most of the time. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

* I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.
* I'm doing mental jumping jacks.
* I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!

You look…perfect. Makes me a … scientist. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I'm really more an apartment person. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.

You all right, Dexter? I'm partial to air conditioning. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. Cops, another community I'm not part of. He taught me a code. To survive. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.

Hello, Dexter Morgan. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm generally confused most of the time.
