# Another post

# You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. __hellip;hey.__ *hellip;the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.* You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

## I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

1. Saving the world with meals on wheels.
2. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
