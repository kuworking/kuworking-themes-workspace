And explore your site at `http://localhost:8000`

### As a gatsby theme

Install the package

- `yarn add gatsby-theme-kuworking-affiliate`

And add the theme in your website `gatsby-config.js`

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-theme-kuworking-affiliate`,
    options: {
      standalone: false,
      basePath: '/',
      path: `content/json`,
    },
  },
]
```

## Specifics of the theme

Store your json files in the `content/json` folder (unless you have changed this above)

The json structure should be like this

```
[
  { "category": "the category", "description": "the description" },
  {
    "name": "the product",
    "link": "the affiliate link",
    "image": "/yourimage.jpg",
    "price": "the price"
  },
  // ...
]
```

The image can be an external link, otherwise it looks for images in your static folder
