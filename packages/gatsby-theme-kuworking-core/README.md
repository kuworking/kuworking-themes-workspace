Core theme for kuworking themes, which you can find [here](https://www.kuworking.com/themes)

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/gatsby-theme-kuworking-core?style=flat-square)

## 📝 Description

Core theme used as a common boilerplate for other kuworking themes

## 🚀 Characteristics

The CORE theme is responsible of

- Taking care of MDX processing
- Pages, posts, tag categories
- Implementing theme-ui and give `Styled.root` context to all (non-mdx) pages
- Implementing robots.txt, SEO, RSS feeds, sitemap, google TAG manager, manifest, PWA and image processing (when applies)
- Providing components for Disqus, Day/Night switch mode
- With hooks to insert scripts and css files
- Components to insert Google Map, Instagram, Pinterest, Youtube
- Components for sharing content to Twitter, Pinterest and Facebook
- Components for codepen, highlight.js and prism
- Components for lazy loading of images

* This does NOT uses Gatsby image processing libraries since I wasn't getting consistent results, and also to decouple the image processing from the online build step (very time consuming)

## 🔥 How to Use

This theme on its own provides very little functionality and it is meant to be used as a dependency for other [kuworking themes](https://www.kuworking.com/themes)

## 🏙 The Site

These themes are hosted in [www.kuworking.com](https://www.kuworking.com), a site about GatsbyJS and WordPress (in Spanish 🌞)
