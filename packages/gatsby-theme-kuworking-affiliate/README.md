# Gatsby Theme CORE â€” by kuworking

Core theme for kuworking themes, which you can find [here](https://www.kuworking.com/themes)

The CORE theme is responsible of

- Taking care of MDX processing
- Pages, posts, tag categories
- Implementing theme-ui and give `Styled.root` context to all (non-mdx) pages
- Implementing robots.txt, SEO, RSS feeds, sitemap, google TAG manager, manifest, PWA and image processing (when applies)
- Providing components for Disqus, Day/Night switch mode
- With hooks to insert scripts and css files
- Components to insert Google Map, Instagram, Pinterest, Youtube
- Components for sharing content to Twitter, Pinterest and Facebook
- Components for codepen, highlight.js and prism
- Components for lazy loading of images*

* you might like to provide different image sizes to reduce loading times, not doing it automatically here since I wasn't getting consistent results

This theme by its own provides very little functionality and it is meant to be used as a dependency for other themes
