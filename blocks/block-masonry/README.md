## ðŸ–– Integration in Gatsby

Since the package does not start with `gatsby-theme`, it is not included by default in the transpilation

Then, you need to do it with the plugin `gatsby-plugin-compile-es6-packages` and include it in `gatsby-config.js`

```json
{
  resolve: `gatsby-plugin-compile-es6-packages`,
  options: {
    modules: [
      '@kuworking/block-masonry',
    ],
  },
},
```
