# Another post

# I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children.

Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is… Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing?

__'ve had it with this school, Skinner.__ *Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children… Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* * Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.

## Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2.

Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.

1. This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."
2. I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.
3. D'oh.

### I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman.

I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.

* Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?
* I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn.
* Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.

I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.

You don't win friends with salad. You don't win friends with salad. I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. Inflammable means flammable? What a country.

Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! Please do not offer my god a peanut. I didn't get rich by signing checks. I was saying "Boo-urns."

Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.

Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. Save me, Jeebus.

Me fail English? That's unpossible. Duffman can't breathe! OH NO! He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.

We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.

Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.

Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?
